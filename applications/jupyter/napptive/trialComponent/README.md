## This app will deploy a Jupyter instance 

__Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform.__

[![Build jupyter-ultimate](https://github.com/davma-io-images/jupyterlab/actions/workflows/jupyter-ultimate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/davma-io-images/jupyterlab/actions/workflows/jupyter-ultimate.yml)
[![Update Jupyter to Napptive Playground](https://github.com/davma-io-templates/napptive-template/actions/workflows/jupyter-actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/davma-io-templates/napptive-template/actions/workflows/jupyter-actions.yml)
[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/davma/jupyter-ultimate?logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://hub.docker.com/r/davma/jupyter-ultimate)

This application is for development only, it is strongly recommended not to use it in production environments. It is not deployed with data persistence. __Deploy the latest version for data persistence__. 

## Pre-installed components

This image is a modification of the official [Jupyter Notebook Deep Learning Stack](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/tensorflow-notebook) image. 

The following components have been added:

CLI Components
- Azure CLI
- AWS CLI
- Napptive CLI 

Infrastructure Components
- kubectl
- Terraform
- Ansible 

Python Components
- TensorFlow
- Vault API client
- Pyodbc
- PyAudio
- pydub
- ffmpeg


## How to access to Jupyter

Once the application has been deployed, open the public endpoint navigating through the web UI to select the application, selecting the Jupyter component, and clicking on the associated Endpoint. Alternatively with the CLI use:

```
playground apps open davmaio-jupyter
```

The davmaio-jupytertest instance automatically gets a public URL. If the application is APP_OK, copy the ingress link in your browser. 

```
https://davmaio-jupytertest-<active-namespace>.apps.playground.napptive.dev
```

- We need a token to log into the page. We can obtain the token checking the application logs:
