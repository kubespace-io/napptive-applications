# Storage components for davmaio-grafana production environment

Deployment in the catalog and configuration and in some cases the container image is maintained and updated by [davma.io](mailto:contact@davma.io).

Please READ CAREFULLY before deploying.

Deployment of these components is not possible with a free Napptive account.

Please check that you have at least 400 Mb of storage available in your environment.

__ATTENTION. You must launch this version of the application to deploy storage components to the production environment of davma.io-grafana__.

By releasing the storage components separately you are guaranteed.
- You can kill the davma.io-grafana application without losing the data and use the computing capacity of your environment for other functions.
- You can test future versions/updates quickly by killing the current version and deploying the new one without affecting your stored data.

__ATTENTION. You should under no circumstances remove this deployment from your environment. This will lead to the total loss of your data.__

New versions of this application will only be provided once it has been verified that errors do not occur with the new deployment.

For more information, help or specific deployments you can contact [here](mailto:contact@davma.io).
