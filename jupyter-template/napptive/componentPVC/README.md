# Storage components for davmaio-jupyter production environment

Please READ CAREFULLY before deploying.

Deployment of these components is not possible with a free Napptive account.

Please check that you have at least 1000 Mb of storage available in your environment.

__ATTENTION. You must launch this version of the application to deploy storage components to the production environment of davma.io-ansible-jupyter__.

By releasing the storage components separately you are guaranteed.
- You can kill the davma.io-ansible-jupyter application without losing the data and use the computing capacity of your environment for other functions.
- You can test future versions/updates quickly by killing the current version and deploying the new one without affecting your stored data.

__ATTENTION. You should under no circumstances remove this deployment from your environment. This will lead to the total loss of your data.__

New versions of this application will only be provided once it has been verified that errors do not occur with the new deployment.
